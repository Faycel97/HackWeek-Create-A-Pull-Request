## Contributing to the Repository

We welcome contributions from everyone. This repository is designed for participants of HackWeek to create and submit their profiles. Follow the steps below to make your contribution.

## How to Submit a Pull Request

### 1. Fork the Repository
To start, create a fork of this repository. This action copies the repository to your GitHub account, allowing you to make changes.

### 2. Navigate to Submissions
Once you have your fork, navigate to the `submissions/` folder in your forked repository. This folder is where all profile files will be stored.

### 3. Create Your Profile File
Next, create a new file named `your-github-username.md`. Replace `your-github-username` with your actual GitHub username.
- For example, if your username is JohnDoe, the file should be named `JohnDoe.md`.

### 4. Add Your Information
In your new file, include the following details:

- **Your name and background**: Write a brief introduction about yourself. This could include your interests, studies, or profession.
  
- **One open-source project you admire**: Name a project you find interesting and explain why it stands out to you. This could be due to its functionality, community, or impact.
  
- **What do you hope to learn from this club**: Share your learning goals and expectations. This helps others understand your motivations and can spark discussions.

### 5. Submit a Pull Request
After completing your profile file, create a pull request (PR) to submit your contribution. This action notifies the repository maintainers of your changes and allows them to review your work.
